this is a minimal(well, almost minimal) amount of code required to run pygame and opengl.
however, instead of using opengl textured quads to render all the stuff, this example
draws everything on a regular pygame surface which is then converted to an opengl texture
which is then rendered. I know, terribly inefficient, but it works for simple stuff.
Why not just forget about opengl and use regular pygame blitting? Somehow regular pygame
skips frames. It can run 999 fps but once or twice a second you notice a hiccup - even though
the fps stays the same. I don't know what causes this shit but with opengl it seems to be
reduced.
